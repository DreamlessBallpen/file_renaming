This aims to rename a target file based on a format from the filename of a source file.
For this specific project, the specific files follow a certain convention:

Example:

FileNameForClient_IntervalOfReport_CharactersToBeChanged_DateOfReport

Where, a file having the latest Interval and Date needs to have its CharactersToBeChanged be following a previous file, without changing the date information in the filename.
As such, this project is being created to suit that need.
